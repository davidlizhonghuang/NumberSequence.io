# NumberSequence.io
 

This test is used to test how to use Angular JS to build up various number-sequence calculators

this testing is very simple. I simple used the math formulas from below links to buld the test.

the JS library from this link has been downloaded and used in this test.

http://www.calculator.net/number-sequence-calculator.html

all functions are javascript based. I simple use VS2015 to build a simple web site that can only have a single HtML page. becasue we use Angular js, we do not need to use code behind for calculation and simply use JS library to run event in a single HTML page. this is the modern SPA technology.
